# Nand2Tetris-Project

This repository contains my solutions for the Nand2Tetris course. The project involves building a complete computer system, starting from a single logic gate (NAND) and culminating in a high-level object-oriented language and a basic operating system.

Project 1: Boolean Logic
Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
Project 3: Sequential Logic
Project 4: Machine Language
Project 5: Computer Architecture
Project 6: Assembler
Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic
Project 8: VM II: Program Control
Project 9: High-Level Language
Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation
Project 12: Operating System
